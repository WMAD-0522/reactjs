/* Challenge 1: 

Create a navbar in JSX:
    - Use the semantic `nav` element as the parent wrapper
    - Have an h1 element with the brand name of your "website"
    - Insert an unordered list for the other nav elements
        - Inside the `ul`, have three `li`s for "Pricing",
        "About", and "Contact"
    - Don't worry about styling yet - it'll just be plain-looking HTML for now
*/

/* Challenge 2: 

Starting from scratch, build and render the 
HTML for our section project.

We'll be adding styling to it later.

Hints:
* The React logo is a file in the project tree, so you can
  access it by using `src="./react-logo.png" in your image
  element
* You can also set the `width` attribute of the image element
  just like in HTML. In the slide, I have it set to 40px
